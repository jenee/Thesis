\f0\fs26 \cf0 Click on the next button in the inspector footer bar, the one with the picture of several book spines on it. This switches to the \'93References\'94 pane (the index card and meta-data area will remain where they are, only the notes will disappear to be replaced by a list of references). The references pane allows you to store references to other documents within the project, on your hard-disk or on the internet. By clicking on the \'93+\'94 button, you can choose to add a reference to a file on disk or you can select a document inside the project. You can also drag documents from the binder or the Finder (or the URL from a browser address field) into the references table. Double-clicking on the icon of a reference will open it: external references open in their default application; internal references open inside Scrivener (you can determine exactly where the latter get opened in the \'93Navigation\'94 pane of the Preferences). Note that, as with notes, you can store references at the document or project level - click on the bar where it says \'93Document References\'94 to flip between Document References (which are specific to the current document) and Project References (which can be viewed from any document).\

Next click on the key button at the bottom of the inspector to view the keywords pane and then move onto \'935e: Keywords\'94.}
