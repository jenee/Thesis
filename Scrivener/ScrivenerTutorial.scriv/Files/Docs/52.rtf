\f0\fs26 \cf0 At the bottom of the inspector is the notes area, where you can jot down anything you want that will help you with your document. If you click in the notes header bar (where it says \'93Document Notes\'94), you can flip between Document Notes and Project Notes. As you would imagine, document notes are specific to each document and will change depending on the document you are viewing in the current editor, whereas project notes can be viewed from any document (project notes can also be seen in the inspector when you select one of the special root folders\'97Draft, Research and Trash\'97which have no associated meta-data or synopses). You can have multiple project notes associated with your project (new project notes can be added using the Project Notes window, available from the Project menu).\
